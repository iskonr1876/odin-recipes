<p>These chicken Alfredo stuffed shells are served in a rich and decadent Alfredo sauce that is creamy and cheesy. The cheese pull when serving is amazing.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>30 jumbo pasta shells</li>
    <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
    <li>1 ¼ teaspoons ground black pepper, divided</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>¾ cup ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded Italian cheese blend, divided</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, plus more for garnish </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>2 ½ cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
    <li> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat; cook the pasta shells according to package directions for al dente, 9 to 11 minutes. Drain and run under cold water until cool enough to touch. Set aside. </li>
    <li> Season chicken breasts on both sides with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken; cook until browned and a thermometer inserted into the thickest portion of the chicken breast registers 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 18 minutes, turning halfway through. Remove from heat and transfer chicken from skillet to a cutting board. Shred chicken using 2 forks and set aside. </li>
    <li> Stir together ricotta, 1 1/2 cup Italian blend cheese, parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, chicken, and 2 tablespoons cream in a medium bowl. Set aside. </li>
    <li> Combine 2 cups cream and butter in a deep, large skillet. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Whisk in garlic, Italian seasoning, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and cook for 1 more minute. Add 2 cups Parmesan cheese and whisk until melted. Set sauce aside. </li>
    <li> Add 1 cup sauce to the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Using a spoon, fill each of the jumbo shells generously with the chicken-ricotta mixture. Lay them seam side up in the baking dish, then pour the remaining sauce all over the top. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup Italian blend cheese and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. </li>
    <li> Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Garnish with more parsley if desired and serve. </li>
